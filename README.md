# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
We have received a dataset of votes from a Colorado congressional election and have been asked to analyze:

1. Total number of votes cast
2. Compile a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the count of votes for each candidate
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate
5. Calculate the winner of the election
6. Calculate the turnout for each county
7. Calculate the county with the largest turnout
8. Write the results to a .txt file

## Challenges
No challenges were encountered during this analysis (except for me declaring variables as strings instead of integers and banging my head against a wall).  A potential challenge could have been corrupted or incomplete data.
